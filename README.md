# Solo Leveling AI Agents 🤖  

Welcome to **Solo Leveling AI Agents** — a hands-on learning series where we build, break, and master AI Agents step by step.  

This repo contains all the **code and examples** shared in my daily posts.  
The goal is simple: help you go from *beginner → advanced agent developer* by learning the fundamentals, best practices, and real-world use cases.  

---

## 📚 What You’ll Learn
Through this series, we’ll cover:
- 🔹 **Prompt Engineering** — how to design prompts for agents with practical use cases.  
- 🔹 **LangChain v0.3** — LLMs, Chat Models, Prompts, Templates, and Chaining.  
- 🔹 **LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)** — building modular pipelines.  
- 🔹 **Parsing & Structured Outputs** — making agent responses reliable.  
- 🔹 **Tools & Memory** — extending agents with retrieval, APIs, and context.  
- 🔹 **Agent Frameworks** — from scratch + with LangChain, LangGraph, etc.  
- 🔹 **Case Studies** — content summarization, financial reports, Q&A, and more.
